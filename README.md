finlib aims to provide a collection of functions useful for financial calculations. It takes inspiration from the ta-lib library (https://ta-lib.org) and from several Excel functions, but it doesn't provide all of the same functionality, and the implementations here are original and written entirely in Go.

This project is a work in progress. It is likely to change significantly in the future, and should not be relied upon in a production environment.
